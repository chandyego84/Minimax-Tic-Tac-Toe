# Olivia
Tic-Tac-Toe in Python, C, Verilog/FPGA, and maybe assembly...  
Because in order to appreciate the ethereal Olivia Rodrigo, you need to appreciate the high-level of Python. To appreciate Python you need to appreciate C. To appreciate C you need to appreciate Assembly and dig into the trenches of a HDL.

## Running the Games:

## TODO:
- Write tests
- Check efficiency across the languages
- Add MORE languages!
### Python Implementation
1. Make GUI version
2. Minimax: use second evaluation function cited, optimize minimax algo

### C Implementation
1. Implement in C

### Verilog Implementation
1. Implement in Verilog
