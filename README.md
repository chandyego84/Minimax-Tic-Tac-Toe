# Olivia
Why the name Olivia? Because I love Olivia Rodrigo and am trying to 
write Tic-Tac-Toe in as many ways as I love her.  

Tic-Tac-Toe vs. AI in Python, C, Verilog...  

Minimax algorithm is being used for Python and C. I am currently trying to write minimax in Verilog, but I might switch to using MCTS to add some more spicing.

### Running the Games:

## TODO:
- Write tests
- Check efficiency across the languages
- Add MORE languages and implementations. Let's write this in 10+ languages and draw comparisons.

### Python Implementation
1. Make GUI version
2. Optimize: Pruning or different evaluation function

### C Implementation
1. Optimize: Pruning or different evaluation function

### Verilog Implementation
1. Implement in Verilog
